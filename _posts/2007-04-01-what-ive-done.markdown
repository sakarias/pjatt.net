	In this farewell
	There is no blood
	There is no alibi
	'Cause I've drawn regret
	From the truth
	Of a thousand lies
	So let mercy come
	And wash away

	What I've done
	I'll face myself
	To cross out
	What I've become
	Erase myself
	And let go of
	What I've done

	Put to rest
	What you thought of me
	While I clean this slate
	With the hands
	Of uncertainty
	So let mercy come
	And wash away

	What I've done
	I'll face myself
	To cross out
	What I've become
	Erase myself
	And let go of
	What I've done

	For what I've done
	I'll start again
	And whatever thing
	May come
	Today this ends
	I'm forgiving

	What I've done

	I'll face myself
	To cross out
	What I've become
	Erase myself
	And let go of
	What I've done

	What I've done

	Forgiving what I've done
