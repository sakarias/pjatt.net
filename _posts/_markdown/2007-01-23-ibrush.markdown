Today, I will introduce something extrordinary, a revolution in the way you look at toothbrushs, <strong>THE iBrush!</strong>

Just put this little machine in your mouth and wait 5 seconds and you will get perfect tooths. You can even plug it into your computer and download a new skin for your teeths, so you can choose if you want yellowish teeths one day and maybe teeths that lights in the dark another day.

And the price: 149 $ for the brush and 1.99 $ for each skin.


Du må ha sett noen keynotes med Steven P. Jobs for å forstå denne :P
