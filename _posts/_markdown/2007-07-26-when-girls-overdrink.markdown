 * We have no idea where our purse is.
 * We believe that dancing with our arms overhead and wiggling our butts while yelling "Woo-hoo!" is the sexiest dance around.
 * We've suddenly decided that we want to kick someone's butt and honestly believe we could do it.
 * In our last trip to the bathroom, we realize that we now look less like the goddess we were four hours ago and more like a homeless hooker.
 * We cry and tell everyone we see that we love them sooooo much.
 * We get excited and jump up and down at every new song merely because, "Oh, my God! I love this song!"
 * We find the spiritual side of the geek sitting beside us.
 * We suddenly take up smoking and think we're good at it.
 * We get mad at the bartender for giving us just lemonade because we can no longer taste the vodka.
 * We think we're in bed but our pillow feels strangely like the kitchen floor.
 * We fail to notice that the toilet lid is down.
 * We take off our shoes because we think it's their fault we can't walk straight.
