Dear Apple Store Customer,

Thank you for shopping at the Apple Store.

The demand for the product you ordered has been higher than anticipated.  We are shipping as quickly as possible, but cannot meet the ship date we previously estimated for you. We now expect to ship your order by <em>September 23rd, 2005</em>.

Please note that product availability can change rapidly and it is possible that your order may ship much sooner than we anticipate.

Your business is very important to us, and we apologise for any inconvenience that this change may cause.

Once your order has dispatched, you will receive a Shipment Notification email, which will enable you to track your order.

Answers to many post-sales questions can be found at the Apple Store Customer Service website: <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/nostore">http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/nostore</a>

Kind regards,

The Apple Store
