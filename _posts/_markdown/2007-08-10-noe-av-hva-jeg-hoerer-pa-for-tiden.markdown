Blinded by faith I couldn't hear All the whispers, the warnings so clear. I see the angels, I'll lead them to your door. There's no escape now, No mercy no more. No remorse cause I still remember The smile when you tore me apart. You took my heart, Deceived me right from the start. You showed me dreams, I wished they'd turn into real. You broke your promise and made me realise. It was all just a lie. Sparkling angel, I couldn't see Your dark intentions, your feelings for me. Fallen angel, tell me why? What is the reason, the thorn in your eye? I see the angels, I'll lead them to your door There's no escape now No mercy no more No remorse cause I still remember The smile when you tore me apart You took my heart, deceived me right from the start. You showed me dreams, I wished they'd turn into real. You broke the promise and made me realise. It was all just a lie. Could have been forever. Now we have reached the end. This world may have failed you, It doesn't give you reason why. You could have chosen a different path in life. The smile when you tore me apart. You took my heart, Deceived me right from the start. You showed me dreams, I wished they'd turn into real. You broke your promise and made me realise. It was all just a lie. <object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UrnCdEPrGKQ"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UrnCdEPrGKQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object> Armies have conquered And fallen in the end Kingdoms have risen Then buried by sand The Earth is our mother She gives and she takes She puts us to sleep and In her light we'll awake We'll all be forgotten There's no endless fame But everything we do Is never in vain We're part of a story, part of a tale We're all on this journey No one is to stay Where ever it's going What is the way? Forests and deserts Rivers, blue seas Mountains and valleys Nothing here stays While we think we witness We are part of the scene This never-ending story Where will it lead to? The earth is our mother She gives and she takes But she is also a part A part of the tale We're part of a story, part of a tale We're all on this journey No one is to stay Where ever it's going What is the way? We're part of a story, part of a tale Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane No one remembers how it began</div>
