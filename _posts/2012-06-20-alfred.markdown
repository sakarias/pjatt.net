From [Alfreds](http://www.alfredapp.com/) webpage:

Alfred is an award-winning productivity application for Mac OS X, which aims to save you time in searching your local computer and the web. Whether it's maps, Amazon, eBay, Wikipedia, you can feed your web addiction quicker than ever.

*	Increase your productivity by launching apps with shortcuts
*	Instant access to web searches, bookmarks & more
*	Browse and play music from your iTunes library quickly
*	Perform actions – copy, move & email files & folders
*	Ward off RSI – skip using the mouse with easy shortcuts

I absolutely adore this program, I have tried [Butler](http://manytricks.com/butler/), [QuickSilver](http://qsapp.com) and [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) in the past, but this one suits me much better. And it is dead simple to write extensions for it.
