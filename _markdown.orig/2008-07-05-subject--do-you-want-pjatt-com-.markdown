<blockquote>We purchase expired domains in bulk and recently acquired one that I think you might be interested in.  The domain is pjatt.com and since you own pjatt.net we thought you might also want the more popular .COM version.

All of our domains are priced at a one time fee of $49.95.  This includes full transfer of ownership to you and the first year of registration.  After the first year is up you can renew for about $10 annually or move it to the registrar of your choice.

If you are interested go to:

http://www.dcinchq.com/index.php?domain=pjatt.com

If not, just hit delete.  This is a one time note for the owner of pjatt.net.

All the best,

Warren Davis
