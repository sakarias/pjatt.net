I am one. An individual, a single, a unique mind. With my thoughts I have achieved great things, explored new worlds and encountered challenges far and wide. But the road stands before me. I have not explored my real potential, but merely spanned the depths of the singular, a terrain devoted to a lone heartbeat, a measure of humanity defined by one.

Freedom is my pillar, my story, my way, but to taste real freedom, we need to join arms and march towards a future in which we free information, people, thoughts and ideas. I am one, we are one, and together we stand united by vision, defined by diversity, alive with potential.

United we stand, together we fall. It's time to define the future. Be there.
