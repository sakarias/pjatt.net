<ul>
	<li>We have no idea where our purse is.</li>
	<li>We believe that dancing with our arms overhead and wiggling our butts while yelling "Woo-hoo!" is the sexiest dance around.</li>
	<li>We've suddenly decided that we want to kick someone's butt and honestly believe we could do it.</li>
	<li>In our last trip to the bathroom, we realize that we now look less like the goddess we were four hours ago and more like a homeless hooker.</li>
	<li>We cry and tell everyone we see that we love them sooooo much.</li>
	<li>We get excited and jump up and down at every new song merely because, "Oh, my God! I love this song!"</li>
	<li>We find the spiritual side of the geek sitting beside us.</li>
	<li>We suddenly take up smoking and think we're good at it.</li>
	<li>We get mad at the bartender for giving us just lemonade because we can no longer taste the vodka.</li>
	<li>We think we're in bed but our pillow feels strangely like the kitchen floor.</li>
	<li>We fail to notice that the toilet lid is down.</li>
	<li>We take off our shoes because we think it's their fault we can't walk straight.</li>
</ul>
