<div align="center">Why do I miss you?
Everything seemed too good to be true

I thought you would always be mine
It seemed everything was just fine

What is it that I miss?
I miss every hug and every kiss

Why do I miss you?
I can't forget how it felt to be with you

I can't forget all the times we had
The good times and the bad

I trusted you with my heart
And now you've torn it apart

All the nights up late on the phone
Is now time I spend alone

Wishing you were here with me
Gives me nothing but misery

So, why do i miss you?
Simply because I can't forget YOU!</div>
